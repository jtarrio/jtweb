# Jacobo Tarrío's website generator

This generator can render GitHub-flavored markdown files and Go template
files, and copy any other file type.

It can also create chronological and thematic tables of contents.

Markdown files must have a \<\!--HEADER --\> block that defines their
title, publishing date, tags, etc.
